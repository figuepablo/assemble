      <description>SummaryBelow, another attempt to model crush using Subset Selection, Shrinkage and Dimension Reduction to fit different models using a determined set of variables. This models were selected based on R-adjusted and Cp and then Cross-Validated to have an idea of the prediction power of the models and expected errors.
Ideas for the future/line of work derived from this:Models could be improved if a series of deliveries was considered, but we donÂ´t have this estimate before official crush is published.</description>

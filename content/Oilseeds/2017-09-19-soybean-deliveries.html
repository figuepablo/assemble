<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Below, another attempt to model crush using <strong>Subset Selection, Shrinkage and Dimension Reduction</strong> to fit different models using a determined set of variables. This models were selected based on R-adjusted and Cp and then Cross-Validated to have an idea of the prediction power of the models and expected errors.</p>
<div id="ideas-for-the-futureline-of-work-derived-from-this" class="section level2">
<h2>Ideas for the future/line of work derived from this:</h2>
<p>Models could be improved if a series of deliveries was considered, but we donÂ´t have this estimate before official crush is published. From this we can derive the importance of having a goo estimate of deliveries, based not only on truck arrivals but farmer selling to estimate both crush and physical stocks. Im not adding a variable to acount for working days of each month. Indirectly this may be accounted through the month as a seasonal component (some months are includded in the best model which has 13 variables) would be good to include a variable to account for loading pace during the first days of the following month. this can be included though SBM_fwd exports but we can add only loded volumnes during 10/15 days. Another possibility is adding loaded % of total exports during the first 10/15 days.</p>
